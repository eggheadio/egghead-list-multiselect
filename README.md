# egghead component template

This can be copied (download zip) and used as a basic template for creating egghead screens and components.

It is a Create React App project that has been ejected so that we can use `decorators` and `css modules` and has been configured so that you can simply **drag and drop** files from `egghead-rails` directly into their respective folders.

Things should "just work".

`yarn start` will get you off to the races.
